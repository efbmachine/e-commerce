# E-commerce: Ogooue Delivery

This is the repo for a website I created for a client in Gabon in 2020. The app is called Ogooue Delivery. 

It allows users to add products to the basket and order them. There is also an admin side to CRUD products and manage orders.

This app was built using MongoDB, Express, Pug, NodeJs, Jquery and Mongoose.

You can access the app at https://ogooue-delivery.onrender.com/. However, since I am using free hosting prepare for a load time of at least 15 seconds. Also, the app is completely in French as it is the spoken language in Gabon.
